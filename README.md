## **Data Analyst Experience and Project Insights**

As a data analyst for the Meri Skill Internship project, I applied several key skills to analyze the sales dataset for 2019. These skills were instrumental in deriving meaningful insights and recommendations from the data. Hereâ€™s how each skill contributed to the findings and insights:

### **1. Data Cleaning**

**Experience:**  
I meticulously cleaned the dataset using Microsoft Excel, addressing missing values, handling outliers, and ensuring data consistency.

**Relating to Findings:**
- **Accuracy of Insights:** By resolving inconsistencies and missing values, I ensured that the analysis was accurate and reliable. This cleaning process was crucial in identifying true sales trends without the distortion of erroneous entries.
- **Outlier Detection:** Handling outliers allowed for a precise analysis of sales performance. This was essential in identifying genuine high or low-performing periods and products, leading to actionable insights on where to focus marketing efforts or adjust inventory.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**Experience:**  
I conducted thorough exploratory analysis to understand the dataset, exploring distributions, correlations, and patterns.

**Relating to Findings:**
- **Trend Identification:** EDA helped identify key trends, such as peak sales months and high-performing products. For example, recognizing December as a top sales month highlighted the importance of holiday promotions.
- **Pattern Detection:** Exploring patterns revealed significant insights, such as peak sales hours and regional performance differences. These insights were crucial for tailoring sales strategies and optimizing operations based on time-of-day and location-specific trends.

### **3. Data Cleaning and Transformation Details**

**Column Name Changes:**
- Original column names were updated for clarity and consistency. For example, `column_1` was dropped and `column_7` was changed to represent months more clearly.

**Conversion of `order_date` to Date and Time Components:**

- **Date Component Extraction:** Converted `order_date` to contain only the date part for daily analysis.
- **Time Component Extraction:** Extracted the time part from `order_date` for hourly analysis.

**SQL Queries Used:**

- **Extract Date Only from `order_date`:**
  ```sql
  SELECT
    order_date,
    CAST(order_date AS DATE) AS order_date_only
  FROM
    sales_data;
  ```
  This query extracts the date component from `order_date`, allowing analysis based on the date alone.

- **Extract Time Only from `order_date`:**
  ```sql
  SELECT
    order_date,
    CAST(order_date AS TIME) AS order_time_only
  FROM
    sales_data;
  ```
  This query extracts the time component from `order_date`, enabling analysis based on the time of day.

### **4. Visual Analysis**

**Experience:**  
Utilizing Tableau, I performed visual analysis to detect patterns and trends through its advanced visualization capabilities.

**Relating to Findings:**
- **Visualization of Trends:** Tableau's visualizations made it easier to identify trends and anomalies, such as peak sales hours and high-performing product categories. Visual tools provided a clear representation of data, simplifying the understanding and communication of key findings.
- **Decision-Making Support:** Presenting data in a visual format allowed for intuitive insights. For instance, visualizing sales performance by city highlighted key markets and revenue generators, guiding strategic decisions on where to focus future marketing and sales efforts.

### **5. SQL Queries**

     Date Extraction: Employed SQL queries to extract date and time components for detailed analysis.
    Data Aggregation: Used SQL to aggregate sales data by various dimensions, such as month, product category, and region.
    By applying these methods, I was able to uncover key insights and provide actionable recommendations for improving sales strategies and 
    optimizing operations.

- **Address Low-Performing Months:** Develop targeted marketing strategies to boost sales in January, September, and February. Consider offering discounts or special promotions to counteract seasonal declines.

### **2. Enhance Time-of-Day Marketing**

- **Improve Off-Peak Sales:** Develop strategies to increase sales during the early morning hours (2:00 to 4:00). Consider targeted promotions or incentives to drive sales during these less active times.

### **3. Tailor Regional Strategies**
- **Focus on High-Revenue Cities:** Concentrate marketing and sales efforts in high-revenue cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City. These cities are significant revenue generators and should be prioritized in resource allocation and promotional activities.
- **Address Low-Performing Cities:** Investigate the reasons behind lower sales in cities like Austin and Portland. Develop region-specific strategies to enhance performance in these areas, possibly through localized promotions or increased visibility.

### **4. Prioritize High-Performing Products**
- **Product Focus:** Prioritize products with high sales value and contribution, such as the Macbook Pro Laptop, iPhone, and ThinkPad Laptop. Ensure sufficient inventory and consider bundling these items with other products to boost overall sales.
- **Review Low-Contribution Products:** Evaluate the sales performance of lower-contribution products and consider strategies to either enhance their appeal or reduce their inventory if they are not meeting sales expectations.

### **5. Develop Customer Loyalty Programs**
- **Engage High-Frequency Customers:** Implement loyalty programs or personalized offers for high-frequency customers, such as those with multiple purchases from addresses like San Francisco. This can help retain valuable customers and encourage repeat purchases.

### **6. Optimize Product Category Strategy**
- **High-Contribution Categories:** Focus on product categories with high sales contributions, such as laptops and phones. Ensure these categories are well-promoted and consider expanding the range or offering complementary products.
- **Evaluate Lower-Contribution Categories:** Review the performance of lower-contribution products and assess if adjustments in marketing or inventory are needed to improve their performance.

### **7. Implement Weekly Sales Strategies**
- **Boost Sales on High-Performing Days:** Since Tuesday, Wednesday, and Sunday are top-performing days, consider running special promotions or events on these days to leverage higher sales potential.
- **Address Lower-Performing Days:** Develop strategies to increase sales on lower-performing days like Friday and Thursday, such as offering exclusive deals or promotions.
